title = "About Me"
description = "Hello! I am Vrushti Mody. A B.Tech graduate from NMIMS University. Ever since I can remember, I have always felt a special connection with Math. It being present in every facet of our lives gripped my young curious mind and I never let go. When I first got access to a computer, I always thought computers were like a 'magic box' that did things automatically. Eventually as I delved deeper into its workings, it became clear to me that at its very core, it was just a machine using math to perform complex functions. Pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering was hence an easy decision. By blogging my journey, I want to set an example for young female engineers to not look upon themselves as a minority, but as an equal player in the room. I want to be a role model to encourage more girls to pursue computer technology and at the same time help those who seek it"
