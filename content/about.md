title = "About Me"
description = "I am Vrushti, a final year undergraduate student from NMIMS University. I'm currently working on a friend-recommendation system that utilizes sentiment analysis and personality trait extraction for recommendations!  I learnt about advanced statistics, hybrid filtering and used the Node.js framework and MongoDB for backend storage. I've been enthusiastic about open source and am working hard to make my first open-source contribution.\nI bagged the first rank in Semiocde, a competitive coding competition organised by ACM with over 250 teams participating. I was the winner of the IBM Hack Challenge, 2019 under the problem statement - Friend Affinity Finder. I was one of the finalists of the Techgig Geek Goddess Coding Competition, 2019 with a national rank:202. I was a semi-finalist of the Jio Code Gladiators Coding Competition, 2019 with a national rank:1304. I was the runner up of the Android App Development Competition organised by Network for the Open Web Mozilla Club, 2018.I love to read, sketch, doodle, carve on chalks and listen to music for fun."
