## Why did I start blogging?

Blogging has the potential to open so many doors. Some might come as a surprise, while others need no explanation.
Being able to inspire and help my fellow coding community through writing is a satisfying feeling. It makes you want to do it all the more. When people respond to you in positive ways, you generate a portion of influence over them.

The more you write about a subject, the more confident you become about it. For me, blogging was an effective way to break out of my shell. As an anxious introvert, I found it hard to put myself out there and allow my thoughts and ideas to be heard. Blogging gave me a platform to shout from – a way to confront my fear of being noticed.

## What’s the difference between blogs and documentation?

A blog is a series of posts, that share various ideas, thoughts, or opinions about topics. Bloggers can freely write about topics they feel passionate about.

Unlike blog posts, documents have a bit more functionality. Documents have versioning which is why they work well as information or resource files. Anyone following the document will be able to understand about a functionality and set it up.

## Are all the blogs technical?

Yes. The purpose of this site is to reflect my coding journey and connect with relevant audience.

## What if the documentation on the site is deprecated?

I am sorry you couldn't find the information you are looking for.

All documentations have a link to the official documentation. It's best if you look it up to work further.
