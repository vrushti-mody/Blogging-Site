## Additional Thoughts / Feelings / Stories
This was the first website that I made from scratch. I chose PHP over technologies like NodeJS, React, DJango simply because Facebook was built on PHP which fascinated me. As this was my first live project, I am very proud of it. There were a lot of speed bumps on the way. I had no idea how to manage sessions or how PHP code integrated with HTML. I also had a bad habit of writing inline css resulting in messy and shabby code. It took me a while to improve my habits and write maintainable codes separated in different files. With the project deadline approaching, this project taught me a lot over the period of a month.
1. Time Management
It is important to allocate the time you have wisely. The core features need to be completed first before working on additional features. Time needs to be divided efficiently between the front and back-end.
2. Be Optimistic
There were a lot of challenges I faced, but I never gave up. If something wasn't working right despite a lot of tries, I would switch to something else before trying it all over again with a fresh mind. Don't compare your project with others. Believe in yourself and your capabilities.
3. Hard-work and commitment 
Its very easy to be distracted while working. Make a schedule and dedicate yourself to what you have planned. Keep up to deadlines, do what needs to be done, when it has to be done.
